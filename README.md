🧠 Cognitive Health Monitoring System
This project explores how data-driven tools can support individuals experiencing cognitive or memory-related challenges—such as older adults or those in the early stages of dementia—by analyzing user behavior, health trends, and safety events.

🎯 Project Objectives
The system is designed to:

Promote independence by assisting users in maintaining daily routines (medication, hydration, physical activity) through automated reminders.

Support caregivers with alerts and summaries based on the user's interactions and health data, helping them make timely decisions.

Ensure safety by detecting critical incidents like falls or abnormal vitals, allowing early interventions that may prevent complications.

Provide insights through exploratory data analysis (EDA) to understand behavioral patterns and relationships between physical health and engagement.

By addressing these objectives, the project contributes to the growing need for compassionate, scalable support systems in aging societies—where many families face the challenge of ensuring safety and well-being for their loved ones without constant supervision.

📁 Datasets Used
daily_reminder.csv – Contains logs of reminders, including type, timing, delivery status, and user acknowledgment.

health_monitoring.csv – Includes heart rate, blood pressure, glucose levels, oxygen saturation, and corresponding alerts when values exceed thresholds.

safety_monitoring.csv – Captures data related to movement, falls, impact severity, and inactivity post-event.
